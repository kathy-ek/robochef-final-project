## Implemented Features

We recall from the use case document:

``` The main objective of this use case is to improve the userâ€™s culinary journey experience by enabling Pepper to offer personalized, data-driven recipe suggestions and recommendations that fit user preset preferences and current needs and wants. ```

#

Our scenario is as follows:

- We greet Pepper
- Pepper lets the chef know that of the keyword `suggest` 
- Upon saying `suggest`, the chef is prompted for what type of cuisine he/she wants
- The chef is then asked for the respective meal time.
- Upon answering, the chef has to choose one of possible dishes on the tablet.


Note: The tablet is in use in all steps to provide the chef with two perspectives and improve the overall UX.

#

In our dialogue, we made use of the following:
- `lexicon_enu.top` open-source english concepts (in a separate file)
- `concepts.top` file (specialized for our project)
- dialogue animations such as `^start(animations/Stand/Gestures/Hey_3)` and `^start(animations/Stand/Emotions/Positive/Winner_1)`
- `^rand`
- speech mode `^mode(contextual)` and tone `~joyful`
- pauses
- during the interaction, different images are shown on the tablet

## Bonus

We also had the chance to implement these bonus features:

- modified `displayinfo.js` that displays page texts, headings, human user input dictated to Pepper and choice options as images.
- We created two template diagrams in Choregraphe to address the issue of initializing and deleting memory key pairs on mount and unmount.
- implemented additional `choice.js`
- We also allowed for user choice by raising an event and handling it in the dialog when user picks a certain recipe by tapping on the tablet's screen.
- We had the chance to work with blocks beyond the dialog blocks such as the Subscribe Event block, insert data block, delete data block, Show Web View block...
